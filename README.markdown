For tracking of synthetic metrics we suggest checking out https://github.com/sitespeedio which is actively developed and maintained.

However if your goal is to track metrics, we suggest using Real User Measurement (RUM) tools instead, check out https://github.com/akamai/boomerang library which power most if not all commercial tools like that.
